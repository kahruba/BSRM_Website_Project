BSRM Employee Management Portal 🏭

A complete employee handling and job-application workflow system inspired by real industry-level HR operations.
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend) and Django (Backend), this portal allows employees to register, apply for jobs, track application status, and update profiles — while admins manage all employee approvals and data in a centralized dashboard.
